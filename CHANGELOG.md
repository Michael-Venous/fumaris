# Changelog

All notable customer-facing changes are recorded here.

## Unreleased

- Preview **Light Scattering** gently fills shadowed billows using the existing
  light field. Default 0.5; set it to zero for direct lighting only. Preview-only.
- Smoke opacity and fire brightness vary less with Ray Steps. Smoke-only previews
  skip flame shading, and opaque smoke skips hidden samples to limit GPU cost.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-10-11

New controls, and fewer switches. The solver now always takes its best path
instead of offering it as an option, so **scenes from earlier versions
simulate differently**: edges are cleaner, large plumes roll up, and more
sparse blocks are in use. Check the capacity readout after updating.

- **Air Margin.** Simulates a set distance of clear air on every side of the
  smoke and reaches further in the direction the smoke is moving. It removes
  the horizontal steps that fast smoke could leave at the edge of the
  simulated region and gives large plumes the surrounding air they need to
  roll up. 0.5 m by default; it sits below Sparse Block Capacity.
- **Large plumes roll up.** The pressure solve now reaches across large
  plumes, so mushroom caps and big rolling shapes form at high resolution and
  low Sub-Steps.
- **Move With Object.** A domain can now simulate in its own object's space:
  parent the domain to a vehicle, or animate it, and the simulation travels
  and turns with it. Emitters and colliders that ride along stay put in the
  simulation grid, which keeps fast vehicles smooth with far fewer Sub-Steps.
  The air stays still in the scene, so smoke trails behind as it would
  outdoors; `Carry Air` carries it along instead, as inside a closed cabin.
  Bakes are written in scene space as before. Not available with Upres.
- **Fast emitters and colliders stay stable.** Very fast emitters and
  colliders with few Sub-Steps no longer make the motion explode: vorticity
  can still sharpen swirls but cannot feed on itself. Fast emitters leave a
  continuous trail instead of separate stamps, and colliders at rest (a long
  road, a wall) no longer reserve simulation space along their whole length.
- **Removed settings.** Adaptive Boundary Padding is gone; Air Margin replaces
  it. Allocate Neighbor Blocks, Boundary-Safe Advection and Speed Minimum
  Smoke are gone too: the solver always behaves as it did with them at their
  recommended values. A scene that had changed one of them now uses the
  recommended behavior.
- **Small Sparse Blocks is off by default.** Standard blocks measured about
  20% faster for the same GPU memory. The setting stays under Advanced; a
  domain that never changed it now uses standard blocks. Sparse Block Capacity
  means the same amount of space either way.
- **A shorter Advanced section.** It now holds Simulation Speed, Small Sparse
  Blocks, Auto Cell Size, Convex Collision, Block Minimum Lifetime and the two
  allocation thresholds. Air Margin and Move With Object are beside
  Resolution.
- **Dissipation** accepts typed values above 1 for dense smoke that must clear
  quickly.
- **Source operations.** Smoke, Temperature, Fuel and Burn each choose Blend
  (the existing behavior), Add, Maximum or Replace under Channel Coupling.
- **Field masks for effectors.** Any force can be limited by the simulated
  Smoke, Temperature, Fuel, Burn or Speed, with an Invert option.
- **Scene Occlusion.** The live preview hides smoke behind solid objects using
  the viewport depth. On by default; switch it off in Preview Settings.
- **OpenVDB sources.** Map grid names from other tools, read Fuel and Burn
  grids, play numbered file sequences with a frame offset, and optionally emit
  the file's velocity grid. Grids with their own voxel size, including the
  velocity grid of a Fumaris bake, are now placed correctly instead of being
  read at the smoke grid's coordinates, and grid velocities keep their real
  speed instead of being shrunk by the voxel size.

Fixes

- Valid empty frames in OpenVDB source sequences now pause emission instead
  of aborting the bake; emission resumes when a populated frame arrives.
- Changing Move With Object during preview restarts the simulation instead
  of shifting existing smoke. Changing it during a bake reports an error.
- Scene Occlusion retains depth changes made during its redraw delay, so a
  paused preview updates after an object moves.
- Baked VDBs are now positioned exactly where the simulation is. Earlier
  versions wrote every grid half a voxel toward -X, -Y and -Z, so a bake sat
  slightly off its emitters, colliders and the live preview. Re-baking shifts
  the result by that half voxel; existing caches are not changed.
- Delete, Bake and cache migration now touch only numbered Fumaris frame files.
  Other VDBs sharing the output prefix in the Output Directory are left alone, and
  folders containing `[`, `]`, `*` or `?` work.
- A bake that runs out of disk space now stops with an error instead of publishing
  truncated, unreadable VDB frames.
- Stopping a bake no longer leaves the interrupted frame behind as a `.tmp` file.
- A Collection Mesh source no longer fails when one member has no faces.
- Importing a bake on Windows no longer fails when the cache is on another drive.
- A duplicated simulation no longer takes over the original's cache.
- When Sparse Block Capacity is full, a newly active emitter now gets blocks
  ahead of empty blocks that were only waiting out Block Minimum Lifetime.
- Baked velocity grids no longer contain stray values when Small Sparse
  Blocks is on (the default before 1.3.0). Parts of the velocity field were being
  overwritten with unrelated data from neighboring blocks, differently on
  each run and graphics card, which could streak motion blur and distorted
  bakes fed back in as VDB sources. Re-bake to get correct velocity.

Performance

- Faster per-frame export for particle, Collection Mesh, deforming, masked and
  Geometry Nodes mesh emitters; faster VDB conversion and VDB-source loading.
- Static meshes are uploaded once when a simulation starts on frame 0, and mesh
  geometry is no longer copied inside the solver bridge each frame.
- Moving convex colliders skip their repeated topology check.

Requires Blender 5.2+. Stop simulations and restart Blender after updating.

## 1.2.1 — 2026-10-01

- Fix baking when an emitter has no particles or active smoke on an initial frame.
  Empty frames now produce valid VDB files instead of a density-readback error.
- Fix disconnected smoke trails from small, fast-moving mesh emitters by allocating
  their swept path and preserving motion interpolation across solver substeps.
- Velocity settings and defaults remain unchanged. Existing scenes and caches are preserved.
- Requires Blender 5.2+. Stop simulations and restart Blender after updating.

## 1.2.0 — Apple Silicon package addition

- Added a native ARM64 Mac package using Metal through MoltenVK.
- Requires macOS 26+ and Blender 5.2+; tested on Mac mini M4, 16 GB.
- Includes the existing 1.2.0 simulation features and workflow. Intel Macs are not supported.
- Windows/Linux 1.2.0 downloads remain available; no mandatory update for those platforms.

## 1.2.0 - 2026-09-25

- Experimental Upres adds shared smoke/fire detail motion with separate strengths
  and an explicit detail-memory safety limit. Failures appear beside playback controls.
- Extend experimental Normal Velocity to particle and Geometry Nodes mesh instances;
  move its control into Velocity. Averaged normals can still emit unevenly across faces.
- Default emitter divergence to 2; Quick Effects use dissipation 1, Steady Fire fuel
  0.5, and Explosion fuel 2 with a ten-frame source burst.
- Default Upres Detail Size to 8 and Smoke/Fire Detail to 4; Upres remains opt-in.
- Delete clears the selected simulation's warning history.
- Include four replacement demo scenes in a separate demo download.


- Replace previous recorded-preview display objects on replay, retaining take files.
- Show Quick Setup only for unassigned objects; use axes empties as simulations.
- Compact preview options into two columns and move Upres guidance inline.

- Compile Vulkan pipelines only when used, avoiding costly first-start
  compilation of unrelated features on Intel and other Vulkan GPUs.
- Add Quick Setup for Rising Smoke, Steady Fire and Explosion, with linked
  participant collections and simulation empties.
- Add optional Bake on Preview: record VDB takes during preview, import on
  pause/stop, and preserve live state for Resume. Requires the matching updated
  native bridge.
- Show action-specific shortcut tooltips; move Stop to Shift–Alt–X for one-hand use.
  Play/Pause/Resume remains Shift–Alt–Space. Keep the compact Play button label.
- Show actionable capacity warnings outside Diagnostics; move Diagnostics below
  Advanced using the darker panel background.
- Default dissipation to 0.5, fuel to 1, temperature per burn to 1, and ray steps
  to 256. Select Density after importing VDBs.
- Batch shared instanced-mesh extraction without reducing geometry fidelity.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-09-17

- Control live preview without selecting the domain: viewport/timeline header
  controls, participant controls, a scene domain picker, and configurable
  Shift–Alt–Space (play/pause/resume) and Shift–Alt–Backspace (stop) shortcuts.
- Add AgX (Preview) tone mapping and calibrate AgX/Filmic brightness against
  Off (Legacy). These are preview approximations, not Blender's full OCIO transform.
- Remove the obsolete points preview renderer. Volume preview remains;
  Geometry Nodes and Collection Points emitters are unaffected.
- Allow hidden domains to simulate while suppressing their overlay. Explain when
  live preview needs a 3D Viewport instead of failing with a density-readback error.
- Prefer compatible system GCC runtimes for the isolated Linux worker so newer
  graphics drivers can load, retaining the bundled fallback on older systems.
- Explain why Smoke Upres is disabled during running/paused previews. Rename
  effector Radius to Influence Radius to distinguish coverage from detail.
- Default emitter and effector coupling to 8, Expansion Per Burn and Vorticity
  to 2, and temperature/burn exports to enabled. Preview density defaults to 2,
  brightness to 5, and smoke color to (0.5, 0.5, 0.5).
  Existing explicitly stored settings and animation are preserved.
- Resolve unsaved-project cache paths to writable user storage.
- Remove orphaned preview code and update diagnostics and profiling tools.

Stop active jobs and restart Blender after updating the extension and native
worker together. Existing caches are preserved. Native Blender playback remains
independent; use it for baked VDB playback.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-09-13

- Collection Points combines source meshes into one sphere-cloud emitter, with
  object-size or fixed radii and automatic per-object motion velocity.
- Collection Mesh combines evaluated meshes into one emitter with shared channels,
  motion velocity, nested collection support, and reflected winding correction.
- Source meshes do not need individual Fumaris roles. Membership changes, renamed
  objects, disabled sources and timeline rewinds reset motion history safely.
- Fixed Copy Diagnostics failing when installed as a Blender extension.
- Fixed Linux packaging when a required library is already in the runtime bundle.

Collection meshes share emission settings; intersecting closed meshes and changing
vertex correspondence retain the limitations described in the documentation.
Stop active jobs and restart Blender after updating. Existing caches are preserved.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-09-08

- Optional smoke detail/upres with an explicit GPU-memory budget.
- Preview light azimuth/elevation, shadow floor, exposure, and up to 4096 ray steps.
- More compact diagnostics and improved GPU/memory reporting.
- Faster native point-cloud emission, reused resources, and bounded cache writing.
- Improved preview pause/resume, collection visibility, cleanup, and loop handling.
- Fixed equal/reversed flame temperature controls rejecting preview requests.
- Cache locks now use OS-held guards to prevent concurrent writers and safely
  release after process crashes. Avoid sharing a cache with older Fumaris versions.
- Read-only cache recovery no longer interrupts scene loading.

- Geometry Nodes mesh errors now identify masks that exclude every face or
  reference missing attributes, instead of incorrectly reporting missing geometry.
- Filmic tone mapping in Preview Settings, with adjustable exposure and an
  Off (Legacy) option. Works on paused volumes, preserves smoke opacity and
  smoke-free fire, and does not change baked materials or simulation data.

## 0.2.0 Beta - 2026-08-20

### Added

- Renamed the product and extension package to Fumaris.
- Migrated bundled beta scenes and legacy cache names to Fumaris.

  that can be adjusted without rebaking or exporting a derived flame grid.
- Stronger pre/post-pressure collider constraints and interior density cleanup.
- Reused static effector textures, parallel dynamic-noise generation, and
  sparse-bounded non-allocating effector dispatches.

### Fixed

- Relative cache failures for unsaved Windows projects.
- Stale preview and bake state after stopping, loading files, or bridge errors.
- Runtime metric persistence and bake cleanup.
- Add-on startup migration during Blender's restricted registration phase.
- Live self-shadowing that could uniformly darken dense simulations because
  camera and shadow rays used different density ranges and stale shader layouts.

### Known Limitations

- Geometry Nodes Volume emission is experimental.
- Preview is temporary feedback and does not create a durable cache.
- Stopped bakes import completed frames but cannot resume solver state.
- AMD GPUs are unqualified; macOS and Apple Silicon are unsupported.

## 0.1.0 Beta - 2026-07-12

- Initial public beta.
