# Changelog

All notable customer-facing changes are recorded here.

## 0.2.0 Beta - 2026-08-20

### Added

- Renamed the product and extension package to Fumaris.
- Migrated bundled beta scenes and legacy cache names to Fumaris.
- Windows x64 runtime support validated on Intel Arc 140V.
- Per-bake elapsed time, peak system RAM, and peak GPU memory reporting.
- First-run GPU shader-compilation notice.
- Multiple independent cache slots for preserving separate bakes.
- Detailed Flow, preview, readback, and OpenVDB timing diagnostics.
- Convex filled-volume collision mode and participant motion sub-steps.

### Improved

- Consolidated installation, workflow, shading, performance, and
  troubleshooting guidance into one customer manual.
- Faster bounded asynchronous OpenVDB conversion and writing.
- Lower-memory density readback and output-channel handling.
- Preview loop reset, point scaling, cache paths, and lifecycle cleanup.
- Boundary-safe sparse advection for fast smoke and corrected full-solver
  substep semantics.
- Linux release compatibility through an Ubuntu 22.04 build baseline.
- Kelvin-like temperature output and a smoother burn/temperature flame mask
  for direct, predictable fire shading.
- Stronger pre/post-pressure collider constraints and interior density cleanup.

### Fixed

- Relative cache failures for unsaved Windows projects.
- Stale preview and bake state after stopping, loading files, or bridge errors.
- Runtime metric persistence and bake cleanup.
- Add-on startup migration during Blender's restricted registration phase.

### Known Limitations

- Geometry Nodes Volume emission is experimental.
- Preview is temporary feedback and does not create a durable cache.
- Stopped bakes import completed frames but cannot resume solver state.
- AMD GPUs are unqualified; macOS and Apple Silicon are unsupported.

## 0.1.0 Beta - 2026-07-12

- Initial public beta.
