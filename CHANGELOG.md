# Changelog

All notable customer-facing changes are recorded here.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-09-13

- Collection Points combines source meshes into one sphere-cloud emitter, with
  object-size or fixed radii and automatic per-object motion velocity.
- Collection Mesh combines evaluated meshes into one emitter with shared channels,
  motion velocity, nested collection support, and reflected winding correction.
- Source meshes do not need individual Fumaris roles. Membership changes, renamed
  objects, disabled sources and timeline rewinds reset motion history safely.
- Fixed Copy Diagnostics failing when installed as a Blender extension.
- Fixed Linux packaging when a required library is already in the runtime bundle.

Collection meshes share emission settings; intersecting closed meshes and changing
vertex correspondence retain the limitations described in the documentation.
Stop active jobs and restart Blender after updating. Existing caches are preserved.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-09-08

- Optional smoke detail/upres with an explicit GPU-memory budget.
- Preview light azimuth/elevation, shadow floor, exposure, and up to 4096 ray steps.
- More compact diagnostics and improved GPU/memory reporting.
- Faster native point-cloud emission, reused resources, and bounded cache writing.
- Improved preview pause/resume, collection visibility, cleanup, and loop handling.
- Fixed equal/reversed flame temperature controls rejecting preview requests.
- Cache locks now use OS-held guards to prevent concurrent writers and safely
  release after process crashes. Avoid sharing a cache with older Fumaris versions.
- Read-only cache recovery no longer interrupts scene loading.

- Geometry Nodes mesh errors now identify masks that exclude every face or
  reference missing attributes, instead of incorrectly reporting missing geometry.
- Filmic tone mapping in Preview Settings, with adjustable exposure and an
  Off (Legacy) option. Works on paused volumes, preserves smoke opacity and
  smoke-free fire, and does not change baked materials or simulation data.

## 0.2.0 Beta - 2026-08-20

### Added

- Renamed the product and extension package to Fumaris.
- Migrated bundled beta scenes and legacy cache names to Fumaris.
- Windows x64 runtime support validated on Intel Arc 140V.
- Per-bake elapsed time, peak system RAM, and peak GPU memory reporting.
- First-run GPU shader-compilation notice.
- Multiple independent cache slots for preserving separate bakes.
- Detailed Flow, preview, readback, and OpenVDB timing diagnostics.
- Convex filled-volume collision mode and participant motion sub-steps.
- Raymarched live volume preview with shared smoke and fire Appearance controls.
- Animatable fourth-dimensional Noise W control for effectors.
- Cylindrical vortex fields with core radius, height, inflow, and updraft controls.
- Pause/Resume for freezing live simulation while retaining interactive camera
  and Appearance rerenders.

### Improved

- Consolidated installation, workflow, shading, performance, and
  troubleshooting guidance into one customer manual.
- Faster bounded asynchronous OpenVDB conversion and writing.
- Lower-memory density readback and output-channel handling.
- Preview loop reset, point scaling, cache paths, and lifecycle cleanup.
- Boundary-safe sparse advection for fast smoke and corrected full-solver
  substep semantics.
- Linux release compatibility through an Ubuntu 22.04 build baseline.
- Kelvin-like temperature output and generated burn/temperature fire shading
  that can be adjusted without rebaking or exporting a derived flame grid.
- Stronger pre/post-pressure collider constraints and interior density cleanup.
- Reused static effector textures, parallel dynamic-noise generation, and
  sparse-bounded non-allocating effector dispatches.

### Fixed

- Relative cache failures for unsaved Windows projects.
- Stale preview and bake state after stopping, loading files, or bridge errors.
- Runtime metric persistence and bake cleanup.
- Add-on startup migration during Blender's restricted registration phase.
- Live self-shadowing that could uniformly darken dense simulations because
  camera and shadow rays used different density ranges and stale shader layouts.

### Known Limitations

- Geometry Nodes Volume emission is experimental.
- Preview is temporary feedback and does not create a durable cache.
- Stopped bakes import completed frames but cannot resume solver state.
- AMD GPUs are unqualified; macOS and Apple Silicon are unsupported.

## 0.1.0 Beta - 2026-07-12

- Initial public beta.
